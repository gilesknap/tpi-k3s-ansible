## Terminal Tool Usage

When using the `run_in_terminal` tool:

- The shell prompt is **two lines**, e.g.:
  ```
  root@ws03: /workspaces/tpi-k3s-llm llm-simplify
  #
  ```
- `run_in_terminal` returns the command output **followed by** this two-line prompt as a terminator
- When you see only the two prompt lines with nothing before them, the command produced no output (e.g. a silent `git add`) — this is normal and does not indicate failure
- Read whatever appears **before** the prompt lines as the actual command output
- Check the exit code in the `<context>` block to confirm success/failure — do not assume failure just because output looks minimal
- **DO NOT use `terminal_last_command`** to try to retrieve output — it reads from the user's currently focused VS Code terminal, which is a completely different terminal from where `run_in_terminal` executes, so it will return unrelated output

**CRITICAL: Avoid repeating commands**

- The `<context>` block at the start of each user message contains terminal state including:
  - `Last Command`: The command that was run
  - `Exit Code`: Whether it succeeded (0) or failed
- **BEFORE** running a command, check if the context already shows it ran successfully
- **NEVER** re-run a command that the context shows already completed with exit code 0

**When you need to capture output for later reading** (e.g. long output, or output needed across turns):

Redirect to a temp file and read it back:
```
run_in_terminal: some-command > /tmp/out.txt 2>&1
read_file: /tmp/out.txt
```

## GitOps: Always Fix in the Repo, Never in the Cluster

**CRITICAL: Do not patch, edit, or apply resources directly to the cluster to fix problems.**

ArgoCD manages all cluster state — any direct `kubectl apply`, `kubectl patch`, or `kubectl edit`
will either be immediately reverted by ArgoCD's self-heal, or will create drift that obscures the
true state of the system.

The correct workflow for any fix is always:
1. Edit the relevant file(s) in the repo
2. `git commit` and `git push`
3. ArgoCD detects the change and reconciles the cluster automatically

The only legitimate `kubectl` commands during a fix are **read-only** (e.g. `kubectl get`,
`kubectl logs`, `kubectl describe`) to diagnose the problem before editing the repo.

The one exception is generating and committing **SealedSecrets** — `kubeseal` reads from the
live cluster's public key, but the resulting file is committed to the repo and applied by ArgoCD,
so it still follows the GitOps flow.

## Cloudflare Tunnel UI Notes

The Cloudflare Zero Trust dashboard public hostname configuration has **no separate "Service
Type" field**. The protocol is specified as a prefix in the Service URL itself:

- Use `http://hostname:port` for plain HTTP to the backend
- Use `https://hostname:port` for HTTPS to the backend

Example: `http://ingress-ingress-nginx-controller.ingress-nginx.svc.cluster.local:80`

## Project Overview

This is an **Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)** Ansible project that commissions a **K3s Kubernetes cluster** on Turing Pi v2.5 boards (with RK1 or CM4 compute modules) and arbitrary extra Linux nodes. It flashes Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, installs K3s, and deploys services via ArgoCD — all idempotent and repeatable.

**License:** Apache 2.0
**Primary Runtime:** Ansible (Python-based), Helm, kubectl
**Target OS:** Ubuntu 24.04 LTS on cluster nodes; Debian-based devcontainer for the execution environment

Full documentation lives in `docs/` (Sphinx + MyST). Build with `uv run tox -e docs`.
See `README.md` for a quick-start summary.

---

## GitOps Flow

1. Ansible installs ArgoCD directly (via the `cluster` role)
2. ArgoCD reads `kubernetes-services/` from the configured git repo/branch
3. Each template in `kubernetes-services/templates/` becomes a child ArgoCD `Application`
4. All apps auto-sync with prune + self-heal enabled
5. **To update services: push changes to git** — ArgoCD picks them up automatically

Most services use a reusable ingress sub-chart at `additions/ingress/` for standardized NGINX ingress + TLS. Extra manifests (RBAC, ClusterIssuers, etc.) go in `additions/<service>/`.

---

## Inventory Conventions

- **Node group naming:** Turing Pi node groups **must** be named `<bmc_hostname>_nodes` (e.g., `turingpi_nodes` for BMC host `turingpi`). The flash role discovers nodes using this convention.
- **Per-node variables:** `slot_num` (BMC slot 1-4), `type` (`rk1` or `pi4`), `root_dev` (optional: target block device for NVME migration).
- **Groups:** `all_nodes` is the union of all Turing Pi node groups + `extra_nodes`.

---

## Coding Conventions

### Ansible Tasks
- **Idempotency:** Every task uses `creates:`, `when:` guards, stat checks, or registration to be safe for re-runs.
- **Force flags:** `do_flash`/`flash_force`, `k3s_force`, `cluster_force` — all default `false`, override via `-e`.
- **Delegation:** BMC tasks use the `raw` module (no Python on BMC). Many tasks delegate to `localhost` or `{{ control_plane }}`.
- **Linting:** `ansible-lint` is installed in the devcontainer. Suppress known exceptions with `# noqa <rule-name>` (e.g., `no-changed-when`, `no-handler`, `command-instead-of-shell`).
- **YAML style:** 2-space indentation. Task names are sentence-case descriptions.

### Kubernetes Manifests
- Templates in `kubernetes-services/templates/` are ArgoCD `Application` CRDs using Helm values.
- Additions in `kubernetes-services/additions/` are plain YAML or Helm values applied alongside the main charts.
- Ingress resources follow a consistent pattern via the reusable `additions/ingress/` sub-chart.

### Variables
- Global vars in `group_vars/all.yml` (well-commented — read it directly). Role-specific vars in `roles/<role>/vars/main.yml`.
- Sensitive values use `admin-auth` Kubernetes secrets created during bootstrap.

## Important Warnings

1. **`tpi flash` USB errors** — if `tpi flash` fails with `Error occured during flashing: "USB"`, power-cycle the BMC (not just the nodes). This is a BMC firmware USB enumeration bug. `ubuntu-rockchip-install` does NOT change the boot device — eMMC remains the bootloader — so re-flashing eMMC always restores the node fully.
2. **`known_hosts` must be `serial: 1`** — parallel writes to `~/.ssh/known_hosts` cause race conditions.
3. **Traefik is disabled** — K3s ships Traefik by default, but this project passes `--disable=traefik` and uses NGINX Ingress instead.
4. **Working in branches** — `repo_branch` in `kubernetes-services/values.yaml` controls which branch ArgoCD child apps track. Each branch must set this value to match itself. See "Branch Propagation" below.
5. **No automated tests** — changes should be validated by running the relevant playbook tags against a test cluster.

## Branch Propagation for ArgoCD Child Apps

The root `all-cluster-services` ArgoCD Application passes `repo_branch` to child apps via Helm values. This value lives in `kubernetes-services/values.yaml`, which ArgoCD checks out at the same `targetRevision` as the root app — so it is always self-referential.

**Rules:**
- Each branch must set `repo_branch` in its own `kubernetes-services/values.yaml` to match the branch name.
- The Ansible bootstrap also reads `repo_branch` from `group_vars/all.yml` when creating the root Application CR.

**When switching the root app to a different branch:** the live `all-cluster-services` Application CR may retain an old `repo_branch` in its `valuesObject` that overrides `values.yaml`. Remove it:
```bash
kubectl patch application all-cluster-services -n argo-cd --type json \
  -p '[{"op":"remove","path":"/spec/source/helm/valuesObject/repo_branch"}]'
```

## Hardware Reference

- Turing Pi v2.5, 4 slots: node01=CM4 (slot 1), node02/03/04=RK1 (slots 2-4)
- BMC hostname: `turingpi` → `192.168.1.80`
- node01 (control plane) → `192.168.1.81`, workers on `.82`/`.83`/`.84`
- DNS entries for `*.gkcluster.org` point to worker nodes (`.82`/`.83`/`.84` — ingress LoadBalancer IPs), **not** the control plane
